# Mushroom Dataset Classification

In this project I've implemented KNN (K-Nearest-Neighbor) and Decision Tree(Gini Index and Information Gain) algorithms with sklearn to classify mushroom data set, and I test my model efficiency using precision, recall and f1-score. I used Information Gain as a default Decision Tree, but you can modify it and use Gini instead.
